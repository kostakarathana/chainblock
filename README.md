## how does it work? 
This project aims to put algorithmic trading in the hands of the layman rather than big institutions. Through scratch-inspired draggable blocks, the user can "set and forget" logic about how to trade:

Under the hood, we use blockly.js as well as a compiler/translator that turns the block commands into custom smart contracts with pyteal and a basic local backend for now. Since the contracts are immutable, we plan to impliment an admin key that can disable the contract too. Users can keep track of the contracts that they have submitted.






7. (For coding submissions) Have a custom (not boilerplate) smart contract on Algorand. All of this must be fully-functioning, as evidenced in a demo video on your README (see point 8 below).
8. (For coding submissions) Include a clear README on your GitHub repo explaining how your project works. This README must include:
    1. A demo video
    2. Screenshots
    3. A video with audio (e.g. a Loom video [like this](https://youtu.be/ZLKR4zE1o6U?si=6na7139wlVNkmJRa)) explaining how your project works, how the GitHub repo is structured, a demo of everything working etc. This is vital, so that the judges can review your project properly. Make sure you explain clearly how you satisfied point 7 above. This is a great example of a winning Polkadot projectâ€™s README: https://github.com/mahir-pa/poap.  Bonus points for if your video is well-edited!

Please make sure you follow the above requirements very carefully.
